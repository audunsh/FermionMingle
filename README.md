## Fermion Mingle - A quantum many body solver
### Audun Skau Hansen | Comp-Phys | UiO | 2014
This code is made for educational purposes as part of my masters thesis in computational physics. I have named the project "Fermion Mingle", as the code enables calculation of fermionic interactions.

Currently the code has the following functionality:
- Gaussian basis sets and integral calculations
- Restricted Hartree-Fock
- Unrestricted Hartree-Fock
- Cupled Cluster (CCD, CCSD)
- Electron density evaluation

Some functions are implemented in python:
- CCalgebra - An environment for coupled cluster calculations and code generation
- TurbomoleConverter - A script for generating C++ code from turbomole files
